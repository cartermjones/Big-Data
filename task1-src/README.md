<b>Task 1 - Read files, extract relevant data, and generate Tab Seperated Values (.tsv) file</b>

The goal of Task 1 of the first project in this course is to traverse a file system containing 18,000+ emails
and extract the necessary information: Category, Sender, Subject, Organization, and Body, while rejecting superfluous data and noise.
This extracted information is then written to a Tab Seperated Values (.tsv) file, a common file format in Big Data projects.
